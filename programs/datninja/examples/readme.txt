Four validation examples are provide with datninja.  Each example was generated within MATLAB and printed with a 150 dpi resolution to simulate a scanned image.

Example A: Linear-linear plot of integer data (1,2,3,4,5 horizontal and vertical).
Example B: Linear-linear plot of 2D integer data with 15 degree rotation.  The resolution of this image is poorer than the previous example because two print stages are used (before and after rotation).
Example C: Log-linear plot of integer data (1,5,10,50,100 horizontal and 1,2,3 vertical). 
Example D: Log-log plot of integer data (1,5,10,50,100 horizontal and vertical).
