% SignalAnalysis package
%
% This package contains data classes for signal analysis.  Core classes
% include:
%    Signal      - base signal class
%    SignalGroup - class for multiple signals on a common grid
%
% Classes for localized signal analysis include:
%    NSR            - naive sinusoid reduction
%    ShortTime      - short time analysis of a signal
%    STFT           - Short Time Fourier Transform analysis of a signal
%    WindowFunction - generates various window functions
%
% Other classes include:
%    NoiseSignal - realistic noise generation
%
% Help and documentation for each class be accessed directly once an object
% has been created.
%    object=Signal(...);
%    help(object); % general help
%    doc(object,methodname); % method-specific help
%
% Function in the package include:
%    square      - Generate square waves
%    butterworth - Generate Butterworth filter
%
% Graphical user interfaces include:
%    SignalGUI - load, view, and manipulate multiple signals
